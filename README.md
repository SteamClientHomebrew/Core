### Adding Languages

To add your spoken language to Millennium, fork this repository and place your language json (based on the [english locale](./src/locales/locales/english.json)) among the [current locales](./src/locales/locales/). Name the file `{your_language}.json` and append the target file to the `localizationFiles` in [this file](./src/locales/index.ts).

Millennium is only maintaining the english language, and if any changes are made to the english locales that don't reflect on a target language, contributors are responsible for updating them. 

### Contributing
Clone this repository place it in your plugins folder and start Steam. You can now make changes to this library. Added changes to the `backend` should also take platform type into consideration as this library will eventually support Linux, OSX, and Windows >= 10

### Building
